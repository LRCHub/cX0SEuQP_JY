Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get em by my lonely
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get em by my lonely

Fettuccini fetching, mozzarella fella
Duffle bag, quarter million cash, tryna tell em
We grind together, shine together, homicide together
Ratted when they caught you
Like you'd rather do the time together
Sat it down briefly
Gave me time to get my mind together
Taking down amigo information, putting lines together
Should've took advantage
I was broke and would've [?] whatever
Do it for my jurisdiction
That's who niggas tryna better
I don't even tuck the chain
Bet you niggas try it never
He accomplice in the sting
Bet you niggas die together
Really outside for the doughy
Like never mind the weather
I be getting sick without slime
I need a pint or better

Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get em by my lonely
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get em by my lonely

Outside, I don't be cooped up in that condo
Durk who, in the streets I'm John Doe
Money every week
I'm sending money off to Dede, Zoo, and Rondo
Even with this status that I got, I keep the glizzy cocked
You don't dance, well this your chance
Bullets make you milly rock
I'm a Muslim with this pole
I be getting busy, ahk
Taking trips up on the highway, hope the narcs don't try and stop me
I'm a high speed, what's going, they would try to pop me
Ever heard that Mac sound
[?] on your background
Then you hear that clack sound
Niggas out here scheming
In the trenches with the demons
And if I say it that I mean it

Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get em by my lonely
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get em by my lonely

I caught a couple licks outside
I turned crip outside
I was taught to spray the whole strip if ain't no kids outside
If niggas couldn't find a kitchen, water whipped it outside
I'm lying, just need a stove and I could fix about 9
I learned to fight outside
They took my bike outside
Whatever in the game get robbed, if you shoot dice outside
Chicken wings and fried rice, I broke night outside
Fuck with these niggas, I tried
In love with these bitches, I lied
I slide like I'm on roller skates
I hear you rapping 'bout drugs, don't know how coke would taste
Jealous niggas supposed to hate
Ain't get a chance to re-up, fuck it, I sold 'em shake
16 shots, Kobe rookie year, you holding 8
Eastside

Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get em by my lonely
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get em by my lonely
