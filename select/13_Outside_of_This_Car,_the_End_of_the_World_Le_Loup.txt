While the world stood still around us
We drove, dreamless, lost and found again
Around towns, adrift and nameless,
Thrown in mad arrangements,
Bruised with orange light.

This could be the end of the world,
Smoke and curls and the screaming bells
When I awoke, I couldn't tell

In the kingdoms, in the bright blue heavens
See the faceless phantoms of the chosen seven
And your wild abandon, well you look like death
And will you call the seasons from the bright blue heavens

While the world stood still around us
We drove, dreamless, lost and found again
Around towns, adrift and nameless,
Thrown in mad arrangements,
Bruised with orange light.

In the kingdoms, in the bright blue heavens
See the faceless phantoms of the chosen seven
And your wild abandon, well you look like death
And will you call the seasons from the bright blue heaven
