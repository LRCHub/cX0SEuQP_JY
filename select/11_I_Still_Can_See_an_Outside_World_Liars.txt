The end in us is a sleeping crowd,
I love youth
I'm to sleep every night
And we follow indecisions, working out for labyrinths
And all the glimpse of talent ... I like
I want you to, I want you to, I want you to,
I want you to, I want you to, I want you to,
I guess I'll ... awake until old daddy sleeps away,
Away, away, away

I guess I'll fight awake until old daddy sleeps away,
A way, a way, a way.
I get to see the light,
And until the shiver comes, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
Dying first into the tragic
Love and lies have moved in here to stay, to stay, to stay!
